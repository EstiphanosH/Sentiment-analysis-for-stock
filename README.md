readme_tail = """# 📈 Sentiment Analysis for Stock Market Prediction

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of financial news articles to predict stock market movements. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system evaluates the sentiment of news headlines and correlates them with stock price trends.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The core objective is to provide insights into how news sentiment impacts stock prices. The system processes news data, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the results to aid in investment decision-making.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and utility functions.
- **`src/`**: Source code modules for sentiment analysis and data handling.
- **`dashboard/`**: Files related to the interactive dashboard for visualizing results.
- **`reports/`**: Generated reports and documentation.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- **`main.py`**: Main execution script to run the application.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EstiphanosH/Sentiment-analysis-for-stock.git
   cd Sentiment-analysis-for-stock
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
```
3. Install the required packages:
 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🚀 Usage
1.   Run the main application:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Access the dashboard:

After running the application, navigate to http://localhost:8050/ in your web browser to interact with the dashboard.
